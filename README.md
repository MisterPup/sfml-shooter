sfml-shooter
============

A dummy shooter (yes, again :D) made this time with the SFML library.
This is just an exercise for learning how to use this amazing library.
All the code written by me is contained in a single file. Also it can be written way better.
The collision code is made by LaurentGomila:

Sprites and sounds are not mine, they belong to the web (thank you guys :D) 

Here is a video of the game in action
